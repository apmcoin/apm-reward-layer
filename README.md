# rAPM - apM Reward Layer
Off-chain reward bridging mainnet designed for real world business

- OpenEthereum based POA Mainnet 
- No mining rewards, earn and utilize rAPM (like ETH) by bridging APM Tokens on the Ethereum mainnet
- Only authorized business users can access nodes directly. End users are utilized through end user services such as [apM Members](https://apm-members.com/).

Since APMs are fixed assets that are no longer being issued, the RAPM used to record them is stuck on the mainnet and out of circulation for a period of time.
